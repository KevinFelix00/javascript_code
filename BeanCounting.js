/* Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase "B" characters there are in the string.
 Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted(rather than counting only uppercase "B" characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function. */
